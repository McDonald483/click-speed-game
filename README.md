# click-speed-game

this game is pretty fun to play with friends (not 2 player but you can compare scores and one up your friends)

the game consists of 15 seconds of clicking targets that show up randomly, you can select a difficulty at the start and when your 15 seconds are up you are displayed
a summery that shows you the accuracy, average time between clicks and how many targets you hit

this game was created 100% by me without referencing anything. 
this is just one of many projects to come, the main purpose of this is to create benchmarks in my path to becoming a programer to look back on.
